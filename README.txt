Original code:https://github.com/pitzer/SiftGPU

I modified two files to make the code built successfully:
/src/SiftGPU/SiftGPU.h
/src/SiftGPU/LiteWindow.h

To build the code,you should install Glew at first.The website is http://glew.sourceforge.net/
Besides,four packages are also need.You should run
$ sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev libdevil-dev
